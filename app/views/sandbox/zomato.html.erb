One of the best eateries to try authentic Bangalorean version of south Indian... The place serves most of their dishes with signature cup filled with ghee, making the food all the more delicious.   The place is one of my favourites, do try it once 😁  Recommendations - Masala Dosa, Onion Dosa and Rava Idli",
